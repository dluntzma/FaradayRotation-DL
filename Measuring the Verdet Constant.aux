We sent the beam through a solenoid containing a rod of material, and next a polarization filter. A photodetector at the other end measured the light intensity. This signal went through a lock-in detector, and from there to the computer.}}{2}{}}

The red points are the measurements taken without a magnetic field, the orange points were taken with 1A of current passing through the solenoid, the green points with the current at 2A, and the blue points at 3A. The curve fits are the function $V = A \qopname  \relax o{cos}^{2}(\theta + C) - A$, with $A$ held constant at 6.2845 V (obtained from the first curve fit), and $C$ calculated by the curve fit. }}{4}{}}
